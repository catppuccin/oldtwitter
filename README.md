OldTwitter users are reporting that using the extension is resulting in their
accounts being permanently suspended without any prior notice. The reports can
be viewed in
[dimdenGD/OldTwitter#828](https://github.com/dimdenGD/OldTwitter/issues/828) and
[dimdenGD/OldTwitter#706](https://github.com/dimdenGD/OldTwitter/issues/706).

With the above in mind, we have decided to archive this repository as we do not
want to endorse an extension that seems to result in permanent suspension. You
may still use the theme, however, you are doing so at your own discretion. The
instructions can be found in [docs/USAGE.md](docs/USAGE.md)
